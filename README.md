# Grazioso-Salvare-Dashboard-w-CRUD-Module

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Maintainability, readability, and adapatability (I'll say MRA) can be achieved through multiple elements.
Writing code in a consistent manner while following industry standards can ensure that MRA are easily obtainable by parties outside of the development team that intend to use the code.
Keeping classes and functions small, as well as emphasizing code reusability, are also paramount in maintaining MRA.
There is also testing, which should be performed repeatedly in order to confirm the code's functionality; well-tested code can be easily maintained and read by others.
Also, commenta should be utilized consistently in order to help other parties understand how and why the code works the way it does.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching problems as a computer scientist can be a very segmented process; this project required different elements (CRUD.py, dashboard, CRUD test .ipynb) that needed to be worked on separately with different requirements.
Compared to other courses, this project required a larger amount of functional and non-functional requirements than other endeavors I've taken on.
There is also the aspect that this project required working with new platforms that I had no prior experience with, such as MongoDB and Jupyter Notebook.
To meet client requests in the future, understanding the requirements is essential to creating an effective program that satisfies the client's needs.
Segmenting the requirements into relative groupings can help to process what different elements will be required of the project.
For instance, a requirement if interacting with the elements of a database could pertain to the production (or reuse) of a CRUD Python module, whereas interacting with the elements of a dashboard would require a Jupyter Notebook module.
Understanding the types of requirements given can ultimately help one to understand what different modules are needed to be implemented interconnectedly in order to create the desired end product.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists ultimately work to create programs in order to satisfy the needs of clients, which in turn can make clients' actions in work or daily lives easier to accomplish.
In particular, the project for Grazioso Salvare (GS) was a project that seeked to make the company's job easier by helping to filter dogs within a database based on different parameters.
By supplying GS with an easy way to find eligible dogs to be trained for rescue, the project has nullified the need to manually analyze an extensive database of dogs that would require a large amount of time to achieve.
In the end, the production of programs and softwares ultimately translates to optimizing time efficiency and convenience.
